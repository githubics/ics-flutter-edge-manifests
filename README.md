# ICS' Flutter Edge manifests files

- **common.xml:** common layers for all the variants. These layers come from Variscite's manifest file, which is kept in it's original form in the `variscite` directory, but without being used.
- **default.xml:** this manifest uses the common definitions and adds BSP-sepeocifc (Variscite's and RPI's) and the ICS layers.
